# SmoothClimb v0.1 üêç

Spurred on by a passing comment in a Snakes and Ladders(S&L) gameplay video ([yes, really](https://youtu.be/lyHzFF1it_U?t=7816)), SmoothClimb finds the optimal set of dice rolls required to win a board of Snakes and Ladders. 

# Features
* (Myopic) Shortest-Path algorithm to find the fewest number of rolls to win a Snakes and Ladders board
* Random S&L board generator, with a handful of configuration options
# Planned Features
* True Shortest-Path algorithm (see calculateOptimalRolls docstring in board.cpp)
* Neato ascii-table view
* Graphical output??
